As part of a class project I analyzed a scram Jet engine.


This is how I solved the problem:

I first drew a possible design with everything in terms of variables. I then put all my variables in terms of L the length from the first pin. I then used equations to relate L to all the values I was intrested in and created a spreadsheet to display all the quanties for a given value of L.
